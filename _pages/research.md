Fields of Interest
======
Applied Mathematics, an interdisciplinary branch of science is my active research zone. Researchers in this domain are mostly interested in investigating different natural phenomena mathematically, which includes mathematical modeling, analysis, and so on. Although I am fascinated by the study of any discipline of Applied Mathematics, with great numbers of fields within this field of science, primarily I am motivated to explore the following fields:

- Biological Fluid Dynamics (biofluid)
  - Stokes' Equations for modelling biofluid problems
- Numerical methods for Partial Differential Equations(PDEs) (method of line (MOL) based)
  -   Especially, I'm especially interested in time integration methods with better stability properties (e.g., [*IMEX* methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168927497000561), [*Rosenbrock* methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12028), Stabilized explicit RK methods).
- Scientific Machine Learning
  - Neural and Latent ODEs, linear and nonlinear Model order reduction (MOR) for PDEs

Sometimes I like to explore (as a general audience):
- Computational Mathematics and Scientific Computing
- Mathematical Biology
