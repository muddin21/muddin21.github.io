Dear visitors welcome to my academic website.  I was born and passed my life in [Chittagong, Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong) before moving to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics at [Tulane University](https://sse.tulane.edu/math) where I joined in the fall of 2021 and working under supervision of [Lisa J. Fauci, Ph.D](https://sse.tulane.edu/math/faculty/fauci). I completed my post-graduation and graduation from the Dept. of Mathematics, [University of Chittagong, Bangladesh](https://cu.ac.bd/mathematics/), where I was awarded distinctions in both cases. I worked as an instructor in Mathematics for a short period at [Prime University](https://www.primeuniversity.edu.bd/department/faculty_member/details/3/188).

In general, I'm interested in applying mathematics to study phenomena connected to our everyday life; which we call applied mathematics. Especially, I'm interested in applications emerging from Biological fluid flow. While I'm in no serious business, I mostly like to spend time watching cricket and football (soccer) matches.
